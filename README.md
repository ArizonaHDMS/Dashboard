# Dashboard
Framework for creating a Dashboard in Shiny -- Version in testing!

The easiest way to run this code is to clone this repository on your computer, then call up `server.R` and click the "Run App" button (see screenshots below)

Or, alternatively run:
`shiny::runGitHub("shiny_example", "rstudio")`

This assumes you have all necessary packages already installed on your computer (see `global.R` for a list)
