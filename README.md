# Dashboard
Framework for creating a Dashboard in Shiny -- Version in testing!

The best way to run this code is to clone this repository via RStudio, then call up `server.R` and click the "Run App" button (see screenshots below). This repository uses `packrat` to manage all the external packages used in the Dashboard.

Alternatively, you can run:  
`shiny::runGitHub("Dashboard", "ArizonaHDMS")`

BUT! This assumes you have all necessary packages already installed on your computer (see `global.R` for a list). I've included a []script you can run to install all of the correct packages. Currently, we are using the development versions of `leaflet` and `leaflet.extra` to use the OSM geocoding tool.
